# ðŸ•› Unfinished

This repository contains a work-in-progress project that is currently under development.  
Features, structure, and code may change significantly as the project evolves.

## Status

**Unfinished** â€“ Expect incomplete features, experimental code, and updates as frequently as I can.

## Goals

- Explore and test new ideas
- Build a functional and maintainable solution
- Refine performance and design over time

## Notes
Feel free to explore the code, but keep in mind that it is not yet production-ready or at least not as you can wish it is.  
Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are always welcome!
