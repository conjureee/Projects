## ğŸ’— "The Pulse" Project

### ğŸ“œ Description:

"The Pulse" is my second project that I've worked on really hard and tried to make it as great as I can, but now there are a few things I have to repair and create later on. As for now, it doesn't look ideal, but it's not bad either.

###ğŸ’¡ Idea:

I wanted "The Pulse" to be an imaginary web-store with some rock/metal gear.
